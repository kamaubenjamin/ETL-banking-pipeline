# 🏦 Largest Banks ETL Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using Python to process and analyze data on the largest banks globally.

The pipeline:

* Extracts data from a Wikipedia page
* Transforms market capitalization values into multiple currencies
* Loads the processed data into both a CSV file and a SQLite database
* Runs SQL queries to analyze the data

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python 🐍
* Pandas & NumPy
* BeautifulSoup (web scraping)
* SQLite3 (database)
* Requests (HTTP calls)

---

## 🔄 ETL Pipeline Flow

### 1. Extract

* Scrapes data from:

  * List of largest banks (Wikipedia archive)
* Extracts:

  * Bank Name
  * Market Capitalization (USD)

---

### 2. Transform

* Cleans and formats data
* Converts market capitalization from USD to:

  * GBP 🇬🇧
  * EUR 🇪🇺
  * INR 🇮🇳
* Adds additional columns in:

  * Millions
  * Rounded values for readability

---

### 3. Load

* Saves transformed data to:

  * CSV file (`Largest_banks_transformed.csv`)
  * SQLite database (`Banks.db`)

---

### 4. Query & Analysis

* Runs SQL queries to:

  * Retrieve full dataset
  * Calculate average market capitalization (GBP)
  * Extract top 5 banks
